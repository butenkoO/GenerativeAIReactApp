I have some react.js form
on pressing submit button I should filter some data.
provide me js function to filter by name.common
data structure is [{ name: { common: 'Country name'}}]
it should be case insensitive
_____________________________________________________________

Sure! Here's a JavaScript function that filters an array of objects based on the common name field in a case-insensitive manner:

function filterDataByName(data, filterName) {
  const lowerCaseFilter = filterName.toLowerCase();
  
  return data.filter(item => {
    const itemName = item.name && item.name.common ? item.name.common.toLowerCase() : '';
    return itemName.includes(lowerCaseFilter);
  });Ð¼
}

In this function, data represents the array of objects you want to filter, and filterName is the name you want to filter by. The function converts both the filter name and the item's common name to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. It uses the filter() method to create a new array that contains only the items matching the filter name.

Here's an example usage of the function:

const data = [
  { name: { common: 'United States' } },
  { name: { common: 'Canada' } },
  { name: { common: 'Australia' } },
  { name: { common: 'Germany' } },
];

const filteredData = filterDataByName(data, 'united');
console.log(filteredData);

This will output:

[  { name: { common: 'United States' } }]

The function will return an array containing only the objects whose common name includes the filter name ('united' in this example). Keep in mind that the filter name should be passed as a string.
