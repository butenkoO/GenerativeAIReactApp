# Documentation for Your App

## Overview

Your application is designed to fetch, display, and manipulate a list of countries. The application provides options to filter the countries by name or population, limit the number of displayed countries, and sort the countries by name.

## Components

### `App`

This is the main component of your application. It fetches country data, processes form submissions, and displays either a loading message, an error message, or a list of countries.

- `useFetch`: A custom hook that fetches data from a specified URL and provides the data, a loading status, and any error that occurs.
- `handleSubmit`: A function that processes form submissions, filters and sorts the country data based on the form inputs, and sets the `countries` state with the result.
- `useEffect`: React's Effect Hook that sets the `countries` state with the fetched data when it's available.

### `Form`

This component displays a form that allows the user to filter and sort the country data. The form includes inputs for a country name, population limit, sort order, and display limit. When the form is submitted, it calls the `onSubmit` function passed in the props with the form inputs as an argument.

- `handleChange`: A function that updates the form input states when the user types in an input field.
- `handleSubmit`: A function that prevents the default form submission event and calls the `onSubmit` function passed in the props with the form inputs as an argument.

### `CountryList`

This component displays a list of countries. It receives the country data in the props and maps each country to an `li` element.

### `useFetch`

This is a custom hook that fetches data from a specified URL and returns an object with the data, a loading status, and any error that occurs.

- `fetchData`: A function that fetches data from a specified URL, sets the data state with the fetched data, the loading state to false, and catches any error that occurs during the fetch.

## Functions

Your application also includes several utility functions for filtering and sorting the country data. These functions are used in the `App` component's `handleSubmit` function to process form submissions. Refer to the previous functions' descriptions for details.

## Usage

You can use this application by opening it in a web browser. The application fetches the country data automatically and displays it. You can filter and sort the countries by typing in the form fields and clicking the "Submit" button.
